# TorqueLearn v3
A rookie's guide to Torque and the skills required for it.

# Server Management
Netlify hosts this server through the Texas Torque GitHub. Hence, only pushing to the Master branch will enact any changes. Netlify, the provider for the website, automatically detects any pushes and auto-publishes them to the website. Hence, it is recommended to work in branches to test before pushing to master.

To access the Netlify page on the website, login on Netlify and link your GitHub account. When it detects you are a member of the Texas Torque programming group, it will automatically grant you access to the page.

## Development
TorqueLearn3 is built on Astro, a `HTML`/`CSS`/`JavaScript` framework. It can be installed through `npm`. Instruction for Astro can be found [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/).

### Launching
To launch a dev server, navigate to the root folder and run the command `npm run dev`. This will establish a localhost server on the port 4321. This website will automatically update upon file changes and will display any crash errors on the website. When launched, the website can be access through [127.0.0.1:4321](http://127.0.0.1:4321) or [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

Other devices can connect to this through standard port forwarding.

## Contribution
After I (Davis Jenney) have graduated, I will very likely not be able to participate in its facilitation and development. Hence, Decap CMS and Netlify have been used. Subsection mentors and Mr. Wolf (or any permitted individual) can add information to the wiki through adding, editing, or removing pages after logging in through an email and password. GitHub also stores any previous versions that can be restored if need be. Documentation for Decap CMS can be found [here](https://decapcms.org/docs/intro/).

### Registration
To register an editor, go to the Netlify application and invite a user through the Identity section in the settings. Using their email, register them and make them an editor. Upon their acceptance of the invite, they will be prompted to make a password. This email and password can then be used to login on the Admin page to edit documents.

If need be, users can be deleted through this same Netlify page. This is recommended after students graduate or permission needs to be revoked.
