# TorqueLearn v3
A rookie's guide to Torque and the skills required for it.

# Running Server
Netlify hosts this server through the Texas Torque GitHub. Hence, only pushing to the Master branch will enact any changes.

## Development
TorqueLearn3 is built on Astro, a HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework. It can be installed through *npm*. Instruction can be found [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/).

### Launching
To launch a dev server, navigate to the root folder and run the command `npm run dev`. This will establish a localhost:4321 server. This website will automatically update upon file changes and will display any crash errors on the website.

Other devices can connect to this through standard port forwarding.

### Contribution
After I (Davis Jenney) have graduated, I will very likely not be able to participate in its facilitation and development. Hence, Decap CMS and Netlify have been used. Subsection mentors and Mr. Wolf (or any permitted individual) can add information to the wiki through adding, editing, or removing pages. This is password protected and all authors are documented, alongside a time and date. GitHub also stores any previous versions that can be restored if need be. Documentation for Decap CMS can be found [here](https://decapcms.org/docs/intro/).
