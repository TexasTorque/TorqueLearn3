# Planning for Success

During a competition, programmers do not have a large amount of time to prepare a robot before other subsections need to begin work on it. This leaves programming with the issue of maintaining organization.

### Roles

When developing season robots, communication is key. A single student will have trouble developing the entire robot, but a small team can split up jobs and manage various subsystems.

* **Lead** - The Lead is typically the subsection student leader, or whomever is working on the robot the most.
* **Programmers**: Programmers should focus first on an individual section rather than skipping around. They should add functionality to their system and utilize consistent inputs used in previous seasons if possible. After their system is deemed sufficient by the **Lead**, then they may work with others to finish development of alternative systems or to optimize their own.

### Foundation

Every programmer, before coding any logic, should first create any mutators/accessor methods first. This allows for others to assist development on your subsystem more easily if you have not developed it fully yet.

### Asking for help

Don't be afraid to ask for help. However, also don't be afraid of waiting it out a tad bit and trying to solve it yourself. If you can't solve it, work up the chain instead of going straight to the top. 

It's recommended not to use AI, however, as it does not have knowledge of *torquelib*.
