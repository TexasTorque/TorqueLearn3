# Configuring Visual Studio Code

**Note: VS Code Docs located [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). Please check this first before asking questions.**

Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used at Texas Torque. The reason for this is the fact that it is easy to use with WPILib and has an incredible amount of tools, or extensions, available to us. A shortcut to keep in mind is Ctrl (Cmd) + Shift + P. This opens the commands which can be used to deploy to a bot, refresh parts of VS Code, and other highly efficient things.

## Environment

To get familiar with the IDE, it helps to first set it up. When you open it, you'll either be met with an empty page or the last project you had open in it. This is where you will write all of your code. On the right-hand side, you have a panel for finding sections of code quickly if the program you are working on is long. 

On the left-most side, we have our tabs. You'll spend most of your time in the Explorer tab, which is used to open files in a directory, so you'll frequently use this in any project. The other tab you need to know is the Extensions tab. By default, it is the third tab, but you can move them. Here, you'll have access to any of the extensions posted by people around the world.

## Extensions

Extensions are what they seem: extensions for VS Code. Installing these will increase the usability, capability, and efficiency of VS Code in any dev environment. For Texas Torque, this means installing a few right off the bat.

- WPILib
- Extensions Pack for Java, which comes with:
  - Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
  - Debugger for Java
  - Maven for Java
  - Project Manager for Java
  - Test Runner for Java
- [LiveShare](/coding/how-to-use-liveshare) (optional)

While you can install additional ones, it's typically unnecessary.

## Git and source control

Sign in to Visual Studio with Github. This allows you to access Git functions in source control tab. You can explore Git integration [here](coding/github-and-repositories).

## WPILib

WPILib extension will add a red "W" hexagon shaped button in the top right of the editor pane. You can use that or use the command pallet to access all of the WPILib extensions (CTRL (CMD) + Shift + P).
