# Installing WPILib tools

The first thing you want to do is install [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) tools. These tools allow you to build code for the RoboRio. This program will want to install it's own instance of Visual Studio code with WPILib extensions built in. You can delete this application if you'd like to use a different version of Visual Studio Code because all the tools you installed will still exist. If you choose to use your own version of Visual Studio code, then you will need to install the WPILib extnsion in addition to the other required extensions. I (Justus) recently made the change to use my own version of Visual Studio Code and now I only have to deal with one instance and can take advantage of tools like Github Copilot made for newer VSCode versions.
