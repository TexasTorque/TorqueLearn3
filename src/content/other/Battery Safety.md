# Battery Safety

Batteries carry the most potential risk of any robot component. They contain a large amount of sulfuric acid which is toxic and flammable. This article will explain how to mitigate and manage the risk assoociated with batteries.

## Why care?

The batteries that FRC robots use is a lead-acid battery. These batteries consist of many metal electrodes submerged in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. If the battery is punctured or spills, the acid poses a hazard to humans and other materials nearby. Also, batteries can get extremely hot if they are shorted out.

## Transportation

Batteries should always be carried with two hands to prevent drops. Batteries should NEVER be loose in a vehicle, always use a container or cart that holds them tightly. Make sure to cap battery connectors when they're not charging to prevent any accidental connections or shorts.

## Charging

Make sure the charger you are using is appropriate for the task. It should charge at the right voltage, and have proper battery management systems to prevent overcharging. On Texas Torque we use the RealPro RS3 which we've never really had a problem with. Not only can over/improper charging cause the battery to heat up to dangerous levels, it also permanently damages the battery, which is expensive (a good reason to invest in good BMS!).

## Preventing Shorts?

The best way to prevent shorts is to make sure metal shavings never get onto the electronics of the robot. Metal shavings can create shorts in the most unexpected of places, which is very annoying. Instead use a drill shirt or other piece of cloth to cover the robot when drilling. Also don't connect batteries together no matter how appealing it seems.

## Handling Spills

If a battery spills, be as loud and obnoxious as possible to get every one away from it. Then neutralize the acid with baking soda, while avoiding breathing in the toxic fumes. Then use a bunch of absorbent material to soak up the remaining liquid, and throw it all away. If anyone gets some acid on their skin, or clothing, they should remove the clothing in question and rinse the affected site with soap and warm water for at least half an hour. ALWAYS take a battery spill kit to competition (there are better resources online for the contents of this).
