# Vision and Screens

Parents often worry about their children being on screens to much, and younger people like to refute that claim. However, it's important to examine if there is any truth to this claim. Your vision is important, and you're probably on screens a lot. By the way, this isn't a research article or medical advice. Just some food for thought.

## Blue Light

There are often sensational headlines about blue light damaging people's eyes. There is more than just a grain of truth to this. Due to blue light's high energy nature, extended exposure to it can generally degrade the function of the eyes. It make be harder to focus or resolve distant object (also a consequence of screens being too close). But these effects are temporary (as far as we know, which is pretty far)

Blue light can affect your circadian rhythm (sleep cycle). Make sure to turn on the warm mode when you're burning the midnight oil

## Too Close?

The muscles in our eye elongate when we're focusing on something close. This puts the lenses in an appropriate position to reflect light reflected from that distance. Do this for too long and they can kinda get stuck that way for a little while. 

At that point, it's painful to try to focus on anything in the distance. Basically temporary myopia. Temporary being the key word. Best choice of action to avoid this is to take breaks every so often.

# Conclusion

Don't worry about it most of all. Take breaks, turn on warm mode, and you'll be fine.

## Rot Your Brains?

No, unless you're coding in Rust.
