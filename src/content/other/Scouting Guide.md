# Scouting Guide

Here's a guide to scouting. Tips and tricks.

1. Keep your eye on the ball. A missed auto can be a huge pain.

2. Say when you miss something, or just don't submit it.

3. Sit next to scouters from other teams. That way you can ask them for information if you miss something.

4. Make shifts, it reduces fatigue

5. When you make shifts, account for the fact that a match in week 1 takes twice as long as a match at champs (longer shifts as the season goes on)

6. Don't rely on internet

7. When you get up to go to the bathroom or whatever, have someone else scout the round for you

8. Always have at least 2 backups in stands

9. Make sure everyone knows the shift schedule, and how to operate the scouting software

10. Add text comments. If the intake falls off, write that down. Seriously.

11. Make sure people know how important scouting is. Scouting is not punishment, it's an important part of being on the team. Everyone has done it.
