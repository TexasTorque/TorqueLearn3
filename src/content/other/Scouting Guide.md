# Scouting Guide

Scouting is fundamental in competitions. In the first half, teams compete in random teams and earn individual points depending on how they and their team perform. Then, in the second half, teams are formed by the students. Thus, it is important to know how any given team performs.

When scouting, it is imperative to follow these rules:

1. Keep your eye on the robot. A missed auto or several points can skew data.

2. We work in shifts, so know when yours begins and ends.

3. Stay off of games and internet for the moment. It's only thirty minutes or so and it's better to have full data.

4. When you get up to go to the bathroom or whatever, have someone else scout the round for you.

5. Know how to use the scouting app. If you have a question, ask.

6. Add text comments. If the intake falls off, write that down.

PS. Scouting is not a punishment. Every rookie and a lot of 2nd years go through it.
